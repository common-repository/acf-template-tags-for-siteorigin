Layout your themes templates with SiteOrigin Page Builder and Advanced Custom Fields.

== Description ==

Control the layout of free and premium theme templates and build complex websites with Advanced Custom Fields, Custom Post Types and WordPress Template Tags. Enjoy the same great Page Builder experience across (almost) all your websites templates.

Use SiteOrigin Page Builder to layout your themes single templates, archive templates, author archives, search results, 404 and nothing found pages. Template Builder works for both standard posts and custom post types.

ACF fields are supported with a set of dedicated widgets designed to provide a simple front end for your ACF data. Any conditional display logic you have set is respected and cross link data is available via post object fields.

## SETUP
All layouts are built using a reusable layout system. You add layouts under Appearance > Reusable Layouts. Create a new layout and add some of our widgets. E.g The Title, The Content. Set the meta data (under the builder) to use the layout. E.g Single > Post.

To build archives create a layout using The Post widgets. Template Builder auto calculates the posts per page setting, but be sure to include at least 1 The Post widget. It is possible to mix and match layouts within the same archive to create more interesting lists.
